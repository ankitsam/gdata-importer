A wordpress plugin I created for a client which imports Google Spreadsheet Data into the WordPress Post using shortcode. You have to provide Sheet Url, Worksheet Name, Username and Password in shortcode.

Usage: [gdata_import sheet="sheeturl" worksheet="workbookname" user="yourusername" pass="yourpassword"]

Example: [gdata_import sheet="https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/spreadsheets/0AqJJ6fnIoHPYdE1qTFF 0OWtFX2xfRHU1OC1oY0JIeVV" worksheet="Sheet1" user="yourusername" pass="yourpassword"]
